The homepage Establishes a homepage that gives a brief description of the app and highlights important data regarding the categories of the directory (schools, colleges, students, investors, and governments).

Display individual pages with lists of the entities that fall under each category (schools, colleges, students, investors, and governments) on the website. Each listing needs to have pertinent details like name, address, and phone number.

Entity Details: Establish a detailed view for every entity, displaying extra details like a description, address, website, and contact details. If necessary, include a map to help you understand the location.
Provide users with a search bar or search page where they can look up particular entities using their names, locations, or other criteria. Search results with pertinent data should be displayed.

Navigation: Construct a menu or sidebar that users can use to quickly switch between the app's various categories and sections
